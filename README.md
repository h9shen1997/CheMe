This app will generate a list of facilities near the user's searched location and educate the user about the surrounding chemical facilities. The user can also learn air quality index, browse the Georgia EPD's website, and see the latest news from Twitter EPA air website. Most importantly, the user can file a complaint within the app, and a responsible staff at Georgia EPD will be able to communicate directly with the complaintee. This app can reform the communicate between citizens and government and improve environmental safety.
